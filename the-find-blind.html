	    <h3>trick 2</h3>
		 <p>The Find Card(blind version)</p>
		 <P>For this trick you will need: a single deck of cards </P>
		 <p>The first the that happens is the spectator (the person 
			 you are dong the trick on) mixes up the deck for as long 
			 as they like next,you need to look at the bottom card. Now there 
			  is a cool shuffle. Hold the deck in a side shuffle hold and
			   bring the bottom (only the bottom card) down, now keep shuffling in-
			   -till you ran out of cards. You just moved the bottom card
				to the top.Now you need to do a force using that bottom card. So
			cut the deck in half, move the top half to the bottom holding a 
			break in the back with your pinky finger. Now riff the corner 
			for the spectator and ask them to tell you when to stop. When
			 they tell you to stop do 2 things at once 1. move the deck so
			  the spectator only sees the top and 2.move your thumb away from
			   the deck. pull out the card you where marking and give it to the
			spectator telling them not not look at it. Now comes the easy part, 
			spread out the deck and look throught the cards for about 5 seconds 
			now look up and tell them to flip over the card (ex.flip over the 5 of
			 hearts) THEY WILL BE AMAZED! 
			 And you know PRACTICE</p>
