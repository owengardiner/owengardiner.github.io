	    <h3>Hello there!</h3>
	    
	    <p id="myCoolText">
	      This website is about magic. 
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>
	   Here you will learn magic tricks and tips to up your magic game.
	   </p>
	     <p>
	       But first a often asked question:
	       </p>
	 <p>
	   Why is magic so important?
	 </p>
	   <p>
	     It is so important because it spreads cheer and it is fun to do and see.	   
		 </p>
		 <section><section class="topDivider">
	       <P>Here are some very good magic and card stores:</P>
	       <ul>
	         <li><a target="_blank" href="https://ricksmithjr.com/magic-store/">Rick Smith JR.</a> </li>
			 <li><a target="_blank" href="https://bicyclecards.com/">Bicycle as well</a></li>
			 <li><a target="_blank" href="https://learn.cardmagicpro.com/p/learn">Oscar Owens Coures</a> </li>
	          </ul>
	          </section>
	          <section><section class="topDivider">
	            <p>Most of the tricks here do take lots if practice,
	            I have been practiceing them for a long time.
	            The best thing to do is practice them over and
	            over in front of a mirror or camera so you know
				what you need to work on and so you can pull them
				 off perfictlly even when
	             you have the moves down. DO NOT STOP practicing,
	            because if you go and do a trick after not pracicing
	            (which you should never do)you will most likly screw 
	            up and you will be giving the fun away!</p>
	            <section><section class="topDivider">

							affect of ways to learn simple magic tricks.In some

	          <p>As shown in the chart above cases are not the best, I recommend making or buyng a fabric case.</p>
